Letter Combinations of a Phone Number

ðŸ”— Problem Link : LeetCode 17 â€“ Letter Combinations of a Phone Number

â€¢ Problem Classification : Category â†’ Backtracking.
Pattern â†’ String building via recursion.

1. Problem Statement â€“

We are given a string of digits (2â€“9). Each digit maps to letters (like a phone keypad). We must return all possible letter combinations.

2. Constraints & Edge Cases â€“

Constraints:

0 <= digits.length <= 4

digits[i] âˆˆ [2-9].

Edge Cases:

Empty input â†’ return empty list.

Single digit â†’ return its mapping.

Multiple digits â†’ exponential growth in combinations.

3. Intuition & Thought Process â€“

Naive idea: Generate all combinations by brute force nested loops. Works but rigid.

Key observation: This is essentially a Cartesian product of digit mappings â†’ recursion/backtracking is natural.

4. Approaches & Complexity Analysis â€“

Brute Force â€“ Nested Loops:

Manually generate all combos. Works only up to length 4.

Time Complexity: Exponential, ~O(3^n * 4^m).

Optimized â€“ Backtracking:

Use recursion: for each digit, append letters and recurse.

Collect results when reaching end.

Time Complexity: O(3^n * 4^m).

Space Complexity: O(n) recursion stack.

5. Example Walkthrough â€“

Input: "23"

Digit '2' â†’ "abc".

Digit '3' â†’ "def".

Build combinations:
â†’ "ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf".

Output = 9 combinations.

6. Patterns / Algorithms â€“

Pattern: Backtracking recursion.

General Category: Combinatorial generation.

7. Related Problems â€“

Generate Parentheses.

Subsets.

Permutations.

8. Key Insights & Interview Considerations â€“

Backtracking ensures code is simple, scalable.

Be mindful of exponential output size.

9. Interview Follow-up â€“

Could generalize to any mapping (not just phone keypad).

Could implement iterative BFS style solution.
