Combination Sum III

ðŸ”— Problem Link : LeetCode 216 â€“ Combination Sum III

â€¢ Problem Classification : Category â†’ Backtracking.
Pattern â†’ Subset generation with sum constraint.

1. Problem Statement â€“

We need all combinations of k numbers (from 1â€“9) such that their sum is n.
Each number can be used once. No duplicate combinations.

2. Constraints & Edge Cases â€“

Constraints:

2 <= k <= 9

1 <= n <= 60

Edge Cases:

If smallest k numbers exceed n â†’ no solutions.

If largest k numbers still less than n â†’ no solutions.

Must avoid duplicate sets.

3. Intuition & Thought Process â€“

Naive idea: Try all subsets of {1â€¦9}, check if size=k and sum=n.

Key observation: Search space is small (only 9 numbers). Backtracking works well.

4. Approaches & Complexity Analysis â€“

Brute Force â€“ Subset Generation:

Generate all subsets of {1â€¦9}.

Filter those with k elements and sum=n.

Time Complexity: O(2^9).

Optimized â€“ Backtracking:

Build combination step by step.

Prune when sum > n or size > k.

Time Complexity: O(C(9,k)).

Space Complexity: O(k).

5. Example Walkthrough â€“

Input: k=3, n=9

Start with 1 â†’ try 2,3,4â€¦

Path: [1,2,6] sum=9 â†’ valid.

Path: [1,3,5] sum=9 â†’ valid.

Path: [2,3,4] sum=9 â†’ valid.

Output = [[1,2,6],[1,3,5],[2,3,4]].

6. Patterns / Algorithms â€“

Pattern: Backtracking with constraints.

General Category: Combinatorial search.

7. Related Problems â€“

Subsets with Sum.

8. Key Insights & Interview Considerations â€“

Pruning early avoids unnecessary work.

Order matters in recursion to avoid duplicates.

9. Interview Follow-up â€“

Could extend to larger number ranges.

Could apply memoization for large constraints.
