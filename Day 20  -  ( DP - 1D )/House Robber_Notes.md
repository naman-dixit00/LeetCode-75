# House Robber

ðŸ”— Problem Link : LeetCode 198 â€“ House Robber

â€¢ Problem Classification : Category â†’ Dynamic Programming.
Pattern â†’ Linear DP with non-adjacent constraint.

1. Problem Statement â€“

You are a robber planning to steal from houses along a street.

Adjacent houses have security systems; robbing two consecutive houses triggers the alarm.

Each house has a value nums[i].

Return the maximum amount you can rob without alerting the police.

2. Constraints & Edge Cases â€“

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 100

0 <= nums[i] <= 400

Edge Cases:

Single house â†’ rob it.

All houses zero â†’ max loot = 0.

Large values â†’ sum fits within 32-bit integer.

3. Intuition & Thought Process â€“

Naive idea: Try all subsets avoiding consecutive indices â†’ exponential time.

Key observation: DP works: maxLoot[i] = max(maxLoot[i-1], maxLoot[i-2]+nums[i])

This ensures choosing current house vs skipping it.

4. Approaches & Complexity Analysis â€“

Brute Force â€“ Subset Enumeration:

Enumerate all valid non-adjacent subsets â†’ check sum.

Time Complexity: O(2^n)

Optimized â€“ Linear DP:

Initialize: dp[0] = nums[0], dp[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1])

For i>=2: dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i])

Result = dp[n-1]

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1) using rolling variables

5. Example Walkthrough â€“

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]

Step 0: dp[0]=1

Step 1: dp[1]=max(1,2)=2

Step 2: dp[2]=max(2,1+3)=4

Step 3: dp[3]=max(4,2+1)=4

Output: 4

6. Patterns / Algorithms â€“

Primary Pattern: Dynamic Programming with non-adjacency constraint.

General Category: Linear optimization, greedy-like DP.

7. Related Problems â€“

8. Key Insights & Interview Considerations â€“

Recognize DP recurrence from problem constraints.

Rolling variables reduce memory usage.

Careful with base cases (first two houses).

9. Interview Follow-up â€“

Circular houses variant.

Houses with cooldown period.

Variable adjacency constraints.
