# Min Cost Climbing Stairs

ðŸ”— Problem Link : LeetCode 746 â€“ Min Cost Climbing Stairs

â€¢ Problem Classification : Category â†’ Dynamic Programming.
Pattern â†’ DP with Step Choices.

1. Problem Statement â€“

You are given a staircase with cost[i] representing the cost of stepping on ith stair.

From step i, you can move 1 step or 2 steps forward.

You can start from step 0 or step 1.

Return the minimum cost to reach the top of the staircase.

2. Constraints & Edge Cases â€“

Constraints:

2 <= cost.length <= 1000

0 <= cost[i] <= 999

Edge Cases:

Cost array of length 2 â†’ pick min(cost[0], cost[1]).

Steps with zero cost â†’ algorithm should handle.

Large cost values â†’ cumulative sum must not overflow 32-bit.

3. Intuition & Thought Process â€“

Naive idea: Try all paths recursively, sum costs â†’ exponential.

Key observation: This is classic DP: minCost[i] = cost[i] + min(minCost[i-1], minCost[i-2]).

Optimized idea: Use rolling variables for O(1) space instead of full array.

4. Approaches & Complexity Analysis â€“

Brute Force â€“ Recursive:

For each step, recursively calculate min cost from i-1 and i-2.

Time Complexity: O(2^n)

Space Complexity: O(n) recursion stack

Optimized â€“ Iterative DP:

Initialize: dp[0] = cost[0], dp[1] = cost[1]

For i>=2: dp[i] = cost[i] + min(dp[i-1], dp[i-2])

Result = min(dp[n-1], dp[n-2])

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1) with rolling variables

5. Example Walkthrough â€“

Input: cost = [10,15,20]

Start at index 0: path = 10 â†’ 20 â†’ total = 30

Start at index 1: path = 15 â†’ top â†’ total = 15

Output: 15

6. Patterns / Algorithms â€“

Primary Pattern: Dynamic Programming with choices.

General Category: Path optimization, step-based recurrence.

7. Related Problems â€“

8. Key Insights & Interview Considerations â€“

Recognize pattern similar to Fibonacci: sum/min choices from last 1â€“2 steps.

Use rolling variables to reduce memory usage.

Must handle starting from step 0 or 1.

9. Interview Follow-up â€“

Extend to k-step staircase.

Variable step cost with penalties.
