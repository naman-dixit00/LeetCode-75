# Delete Node in a BST

üîó Problem Link : LeetCode 450 ‚Äì Delete Node in a BST

‚Ä¢ Problem Classification :
Category ‚Üí Binary Search Trees (BST)
Pattern ‚Üí Recursive Search + Node Replacement

1. Problem Statement

We are given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST) and an integer key. We need to delete the node with value = key while still maintaining the properties of a BST. If the node does not exist, simply return the unchanged tree.

BST properties must remain valid after deletion.

2. Constraints & Edge Cases

Number of nodes: 0 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 10‚Å¥

Node values: -10‚Åµ ‚â§ val ‚â§ 10‚Åµ

Each node has a unique value.

Root is always a valid BST.

Key range: -10‚Åµ ‚â§ key ‚â§ 10‚Åµ

Edge Cases:

Empty tree ‚Üí return NULL.

Node not present ‚Üí tree unchanged.

Node is a leaf ‚Üí just remove it.

Node has one child ‚Üí replace it with its child.

Node has two children ‚Üí replace with inorder successor (smallest in right subtree) or predecessor (largest in left subtree).

3. Intuition & Thought Process

First thought: Use the recursive BST property (go left if key < root, go right if key > root).

Key observation:

Deletion has three cases:

Leaf node ‚Üí simple removal.

One child ‚Üí bypass the node and return the child.

Two children ‚Üí replace with inorder successor, then recursively delete successor.

Reasoning: Inorder successor ensures BST ordering is preserved.

4. Approaches & Complexity Analysis

Approach (Recursive Search + Replacement):

Search for the node using BST property.

If found:

No child ‚Üí return NULL.

One child ‚Üí return that child.

Two children ‚Üí find inorder successor, swap values, and delete recursively.

Time Complexity: O(h), where h = tree height (O(log n) for balanced BST, O(n) for skewed).
Space Complexity: O(h) recursion stack.

5. Example Walkthrough

Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 3

Search path: 5 ‚Üí 3 (found).

Node 3 has two children (2,4).

Replace 3 with inorder successor (4).

Delete 4 from subtree.

Final tree: [5,4,6,2,null,null,7]

6. Patterns / Algorithms

BST recursive search.

Inorder successor/predecessor logic.

8. Key Insights & Interview Considerations

Must preserve BST ordering at all times.

The tricky part is two-child deletion.

Common pitfall: forgetting to update child pointers after deletion.

9. Interview Follow-up

Discuss iterative implementation.

Optimize to reduce recursion depth.

Compare use of inorder successor vs predecessor.
