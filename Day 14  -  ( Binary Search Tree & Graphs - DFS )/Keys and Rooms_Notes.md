# Keys and Rooms

ðŸ”— Problem Link : LeetCode 841 â€“ Keys and Rooms

â€¢ Problem Classification :
Category â†’ Graph Traversal
Pattern â†’ BFS / DFS Reachability

1. Problem Statement

We have n rooms (0 to n-1). Only room 0 is unlocked initially. Each room contains keys that open other rooms. We need to check if all rooms can be visited.

2. Constraints & Edge Cases

2 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 1000

Sum of all keys â‰¤ 3000

Keys are unique within a room.

Edge Cases:

Keys form a simple chain â†’ always true.

A cycle of rooms but one isolated room â†’ false.

Graph fully connected â†’ true.

3. Intuition & Thought Process

First thought: This is just a graph reachability problem.

Observation: Keys = edges, Rooms = nodes.

Naive idea: Try brute-force visiting repeatedly until no new rooms.

Better idea: Use DFS/BFS from room 0 and see if all rooms get visited.

4. Approaches & Complexity Analysis

Approach (DFS/BFS):

Start with room 0.

Use a stack/queue to traverse.

Mark visited rooms.

At the end, check if all rooms visited.

Time Complexity: O(n + k) (n = rooms, k = total keys)
Space Complexity: O(n) visited array

5. Example Walkthrough

Input: rooms = [[1],[2],[3],[]]

Start from room 0 â†’ get key 1.

Enter room 1 â†’ get key 2.

Enter room 2 â†’ get key 3.

Enter room 3.

All visited â†’ true.

6. Patterns / Algorithms

Graph DFS / BFS.

Reachability problem.

8. Key Insights & Interview Considerations

Model keys as directed edges.

Equivalent to checking strong connectivity from node 0.

9. Interview Follow-up

Modify for weighted rooms (time cost).

Return the order of visiting instead of boolean.
