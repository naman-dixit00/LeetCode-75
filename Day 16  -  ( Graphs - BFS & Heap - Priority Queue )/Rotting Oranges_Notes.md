Rotting Oranges

ðŸ”— Problem Link : LeetCode 994 â€“ Rotting Oranges

â€¢ Problem Classification :
Category â†’ Graph Traversal (BFS)
Pattern â†’ Multi-source BFS with time simulation

1. Problem Statement -

We are given an m Ã— n grid where each cell can be:

0 â†’ empty cell

1 â†’ fresh orange

2 â†’ rotten orange

Every minute, a fresh orange adjacent (up, down, left, right) to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

We need to compute the minimum number of minutes required for all oranges to rot. If impossible, return -1.

2. Constraints & Edge Cases -

Input size: 1 â‰¤ m, n â‰¤ 10

Grid values: only {0,1,2}

Key condition: grid[i][i] == 1 always true for oranges.

Edge Cases:

If initially no fresh oranges â†’ return 0.

If fresh oranges exist but no rotten orange to start â†’ return -1.

Smallest grid (1Ã—1) cases.

Large grid with oranges at corners, requiring maximum spread time.

3. Intuition & Thought Process -

First thought: Rotting spreads step by step like waves. This is BFS-like behavior.

Naive idea: For every fresh orange, simulate rotting manually â†’ too slow.

Key observation: Instead of spreading from fresh to rotten, we spread from all rotten oranges at once (multi-source BFS).

BFS ensures we calculate the minimum minutes layer by layer.

At the end, if any fresh orange remains â†’ return -1.

4. Approaches & Complexity Analysis -
â€¢ Brute Force Approach

Keep scanning the grid in loops, rotting fresh oranges repeatedly until no change.

Time Complexity: O(m Ã— n Ã— max(m,n))

Space Complexity: O(1)

Very inefficient for bigger grids.

â€¢ Optimized BFS Approach

Step 1: Push all rotten oranges into a queue initially.

Step 2: Perform BFS layer by layer â†’ rotting neighbors.

Step 3: Keep track of time elapsed.

Step 4: After BFS, check if any fresh orange remains.

Time Complexity: O(m Ã— n)
Space Complexity: O(m Ã— n) for queue

5. Example Walkthrough -

Example 1:

Input: [[2,1,1],
        [1,1,0],
        [0,1,1]]


Initial rotten = (0,0)

After 1 min: (0,1),(1,0) rot.

After 2 min: (0,2),(1,1) rot.

After 3 min: (2,1) rot.

After 4 min: (2,2) rot.
Output â†’ 4

6. Patterns / Algorithms -

Primary â†’ Multi-source BFS

General â†’ Graph + Matrix traversal

8. Key Insights & Interview Considerations -

BFS from all rotten at once is the trick.

Ensure correct time tracking â†’ minutes = BFS layers.

Watch for impossible cases.
