# Maximum Twin Sum of a Linked List

üîó Problem Link : LeetCode 2130 ‚Äì Maximum Twin Sum of a Linked List

‚Ä¢ Problem Classification :
Category ‚Üí Linked List, Two-Pointer, Array Conversion
Pattern ‚Üí Symmetric Index Pairing + Maximum Pair Sum

1. Problem Statement

In a linked list of size n (where n is even), the i-th node is called the twin of the (n-1-i)-th node.

The twin sum = value of a node + value of its twin.
We need to return the maximum twin sum of the linked list.

2. Constraints & Edge Cases

Input size: 2 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 10‚Åµ (and n is even)

Node values: 1 ‚â§ Node.val ‚â§ 10‚Åµ

Edge Cases:

Smallest list with 2 nodes

Very large list (up to 10‚Åµ nodes)

All values equal (max sum repeats)

Increasing / decreasing linked list values

3. Intuition & Thought Process

First thought: Pair symmetric nodes (i and n-1-i).

Naive idea: Copy all values into an array, then compute pair sums.

Optimized idea: Use fast and slow pointers to find the middle ‚Üí reverse the second half ‚Üí pair nodes while traversing.

4. Approaches & Complexity Analysis

Approach 1 (Array Conversion):

Traverse linked list, store values in array.

Compute twin sums from both ends.

Time: O(n)

Space: O(n)

Approach 2 (In-place Reverse Second Half):

Find middle using slow/fast pointer.

Reverse second half of list.

Traverse first & second halves together to compute max sum.

Time: O(n)

Space: O(1)

5. Example Walkthrough

Input: head = [5,4,2,1]

Twin pairs: (5+1)=6, (4+2)=6

Maximum twin sum = 6

Input: head = [1,100000]

Twin pair: (1+100000)=100001

Maximum twin sum = 100001

8. Key Insights & Interview Considerations

Efficient solution avoids O(n) extra memory.

Fast/slow pointer is critical.

Pitfall: Forgetting to reverse back the list (if required).

9. Interview Follow-up

Extend to odd-length lists (skip middle element).

Apply similar logic for circular linked lists.
