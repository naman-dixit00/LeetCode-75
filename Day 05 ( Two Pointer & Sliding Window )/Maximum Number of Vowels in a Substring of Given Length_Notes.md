Maximum Number of Vowels in a Substring of Given Length

ðŸ”— Problem Link : LeetCode 1456 â€“ Maximum Number of Vowels in a Substring of Given Length

â€¢ Problem Classification :

Category â†’ String / Sliding Window

Pattern â†’ Fixed-size Window + Vowel Counting

â€¢ Problem Statement -
We are given a string s and an integer k.
We must return the maximum number of vowels in any substring of length k.

â€¢ Constraints & Edge Cases -

Input size: 1 <= s.length <= 10^5

Characters: lowercase English letters only.

1 <= k <= s.length.

Edge Cases:

All characters are vowels.

No vowels at all.

Very large k close to s.length.

k = 1 (check single chars).

â€¢ Intuition & Thought Process -

First thought : For each substring count vowels â†’ O(n*k).

Better : Sliding window with running vowel count.

Key observation : Only one character enters/leaves window per step.

â€¢ Approaches & Complexity -

Brute Force :

Count vowels in each substring separately.

Time: O(n*k), Space: O(1).

Optimized Sliding Window :

Initialize count of vowels in first window.

For each next window:

Subtract contribution of outgoing char.

Add contribution of incoming char.

Track max.

Time: O(n).

Space: O(1).

â€¢ Example Walkthrough -
Input: s = "abciiidef", k = 3

"abc" â†’ 1 vowel

"bci" â†’ 1

"cii" â†’ 2

"iii" â†’ 3 (max)

Output = 3

â€¢ Key Insights -

Vowel check can be done in O(1) using hashset.

Window approach guarantees O(n).
