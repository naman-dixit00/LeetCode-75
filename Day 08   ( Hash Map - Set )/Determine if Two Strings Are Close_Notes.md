# Determine if Two Strings Are Close

ðŸ”— Problem Link : LeetCode 1657 â€“ Determine if Two Strings Are Close

â€¢ Problem Classification :

Category â†’ String / Frequency Analysis

Pattern â†’ Compare Character Sets + Compare Frequency Multisets

â€¢ Problem Statement -

We are given two strings word1 and word2.
They are considered close if one can transform into the other by:

Swapping any two characters.

Transforming every occurrence of one character into another existing character (and vice versa).

Return true if the two strings are close, else return false.

â€¢ Constraints & Edge Cases -

1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 10^5

Lowercase English letters only.

Critical Cases:

Strings with different unique character sets â†’ always false.

Same set of characters but different frequency distribution â†’ may or may not be close depending on counts.

Very large input sizes require O(n).

â€¢ Intuition & Thought Process -

First Thought:
Swaps mean order doesnâ€™t matter.
Transformations mean we can rename characters but must keep frequency counts.

So conditions are:

Same unique character set.

Multisets of frequencies are equal.

Analogy:
Think of letters as colors of beads:

Condition 1: Both strings must have the same set of colors.

Condition 2: The multiset of bead counts must match.

â€¢ Approaches & Complexity -

Brute Force:
Try applying operations directly â†’ infeasible.

Optimized:

Count frequencies of letters in both strings.

Compare unique character sets.

Sort frequencies and compare.

Time: O(n + 26 log 26).

Space: O(26).

â€¢ Example Walkthrough -

Example 1:
word1 = "abc", word2 = "bca"

Sets = {a,b,c}, {a,b,c} â†’ match.

Frequencies = {1,1,1}, {1,1,1} â†’ match.

Output = true.

Example 2:
word1 = "a", word2 = "aa"

Sets = {a}, {a}.

Frequencies = {1}, {2}.

Output = false.

Example 3:
word1 = "cabbba", word2 = "abbccc"

Sets = {a,b,c}, {a,b,c}.

Frequencies = {3,2,1}, {3,2,1}.

Output = true.

â€¢ Patterns / Algorithms -

Frequency arrays

Multiset comparison

Sorting fixed size arrays

â€¢ Key Insights & Interview Considerations -

Must check character set equality first.

Sorting frequency arrays is negligible since alphabet = 26.

Pitfall: Students often forget that different sets of characters canâ€™t transform.

Elegant O(n) solution possible.
