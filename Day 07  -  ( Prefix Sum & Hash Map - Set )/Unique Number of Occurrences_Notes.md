# Unique Number of Occurrences

ðŸ”— Problem Link : LeetCode 1207 â€“ Unique Number of Occurrences

â€¢ Problem Classification :

Category â†’ Array / Hashing

Pattern â†’ Frequency Counting + Uniqueness Check

â€¢ Problem Statement -

We are given an array arr.
We must check whether the number of occurrences of each value is unique.

Return true if all frequencies are distinct.

Return false otherwise.

â€¢ Constraints & Edge Cases -

1 <= arr.length <= 1000

-1000 <= arr[i] <= 1000

Critical Cases:

Single element array â†’ always true.

All elements equal â†’ frequency is unique, return true.

All elements distinct â†’ frequencies = {1,1,1...}, not unique â†’ return false.

Negative numbers mixed with positive.

â€¢ Intuition & Thought Process -

First Thought:
Count occurrences with a map.
Then, for each frequency, check if it repeats.
Naive â†’ O(nÂ²).

Optimized Idea:
Use a set to track frequencies:

If we insert all frequencies into a set, duplicates disappear.

Compare set size vs map size.

If they differ â†’ not unique.

Analogy:
Imagine students in a class grouped by T-shirt color.

Frequency = how many students have the same color.

If two colors end up with the same number of students â†’ uniqueness violated.

â€¢ Approaches & Complexity -

1. Brute Force:

Count frequencies.

Check pairwise duplicates.

Time: O(nÂ²).

2. Optimized Approach:

Step 1: Count with hashmap.

Step 2: Insert counts into set.

Step 3: Compare sizes.

Time: O(n).

Space: O(n).

â€¢ Example Walkthrough -

Example 1:
arr = [1,2,2,1,1,3]

Counts: {1â†’3, 2â†’2, 3â†’1}

Frequencies = [3,2,1], unique.

Output = true.

Example 2:
arr = [1,2]

Counts: {1â†’1, 2â†’1}

Frequencies = [1,1], not unique.

Output = false.

Example 3:
arr = [-3,0,1,-3,1,1,1,-3,10,0]

Counts: {-3â†’3, 0â†’2, 1â†’4, 10â†’1}

Frequencies = [3,2,4,1], unique.

Output = true.

â€¢ Key Insights & Interview Considerations -

Clever trick: compare size of frequency map vs size of frequency set.

Edge case: all values distinct (fails).

Handles negatives naturally.

Pitfall: Confusing "unique numbers" with "unique frequencies".
