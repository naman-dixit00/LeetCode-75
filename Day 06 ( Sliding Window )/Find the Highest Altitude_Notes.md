Day 6 â€“ Find the Highest Altitude

ðŸ”— Problem Link : LeetCode 1732 â€“ Find the Highest Altitude
(https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-highest-altitude/
)

â€¢ Problem Classification :

Category â†’ Array / Prefix Sum

Pattern â†’ Cumulative Sum + Maximum Tracking

â€¢ Problem Statement -
A biker goes on a road trip with n + 1 points at different altitudes. Starting at altitude 0, the gain array of length n represents net change in altitude between consecutive points.
Return the highest altitude reached during the trip.

â€¢ Constraints & Edge Cases -

Input size: 1 <= gain.length <= 100

Values: -100 <= gain[i] <= 100

â€¢ Edge Cases :

All negative gains â†’ highest = 0

All positive gains â†’ highest = sum of gains

Mix of positive and negative â†’ track cumulative max

â€¢ Intuition & Thought Process -

First thought : Maintain cumulative sum of altitudes while iterating through gain.

Key observation : Maximum altitude = max(cumulative sum, 0)

â€¢ Approaches & Complexity Analysis -

â€¢ Brute Force :

Compute altitude array fully, then find max

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n)

â€¢ Optimized Approach :

Initialize currentAltitude = 0 and maxAltitude = 0

Iterate gain â†’ update currentAltitude += gain[i]

Update maxAltitude = max(maxAltitude, currentAltitude)

Return maxAltitude

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1)

â€¢ Example Walkthrough -

Example 1:
Input: gain = [-5,1,5,0,-7]
Altitudes: [0,-5,-4,1,1,-6] â†’ max = 1
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: gain = [-4,-3,-2,-1,4,3,2]
Altitudes: [0,-4,-7,-9,-10,-6,-3,-1] â†’ max = 0
Output: 0

â€¢ Patterns / Algorithms -

Primary Pattern : Prefix Sum + Max Tracking

General Category : Array / Linear Scan
