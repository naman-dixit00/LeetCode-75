Day X ‚Äì Maximum Level Sum of a Binary Tree

üîó Problem Link : LeetCode 1161 ‚Äì Maximum Level Sum of a Binary Tree

‚Ä¢ Problem Classification :
Category ‚Üí Binary Tree / BFS
Pattern ‚Üí Level Order Traversal + Sum Aggregation

1. Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, return the smallest level x such that the sum of nodes at that level is maximal.

2. Constraints & Edge Cases

Nodes count: 1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 10‚Å¥

Values: -10‚Åµ ‚â§ Node.val ‚â§ 10‚Åµ

Edge Cases:

Single-node tree ‚Üí return level 1

Multiple levels with same sum ‚Üí choose smallest level

Large negative values

3. Intuition & Thought Process

First thought: Traverse level by level, compute sums.

Naive idea: DFS with level ‚Üí store sums in map.

Optimized idea: BFS with queue, track level sum directly.

4. Approaches & Complexity Analysis

Approach (BFS):

Perform BFS, track level index.

Compute sum per level.

Track max sum and corresponding level.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n) (queue)

5. Example Walkthrough

Input: root = [1,7,0,7,-8,null,null]

Level 1: sum=1

Level 2: sum=7+0=7

Level 3: sum=7+(-8)=-1
Max = 7 ‚Üí Level = 2

6. Patterns / Algorithms

BFS traversal

Level aggregation

7. Related Problems

Level Order Traversal

Average of Levels in Binary Tree

8. Key Insights & Interview Considerations

BFS is natural for level aggregation.

Pitfall: choosing smallest level in ties.

9. Interview Follow-up

Return list of all max-sum levels.

Extend to weighted graphs.
