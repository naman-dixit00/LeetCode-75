# Unique Paths

ðŸ”— Problem Link : LeetCode 62 â€“ Unique Paths

â€¢ Problem Classification : Category â†’ Dynamic Programming / Combinatorics.
Pattern â†’ Grid Traversal + Path Counting.

1. Problem Statement â€“

You are given an mÃ—n grid. A robot starts at the top-left corner (0,0) and wants to reach the bottom-right corner (m-1, n-1).

The robot can only move right or down at any step.

Return the number of unique paths the robot can take to reach the destination.

The number of paths is guaranteed to fit within 2Ã—10^9, so integer overflow is not a concern.

2. Constraints & Edge Cases â€“

Input size: 1 â‰¤ m, n â‰¤ 100

Edge Cases:

Grid with 1 row or 1 column â†’ Only one path (straight line)

Grid is small (2Ã—2) â†’ Simple combinatorial count

Large grids â†’ Must use DP or combinatorial formula; naive recursion will time out

3. Intuition & Thought Process â€“

First thought: Enumerate all paths â†’ exponential time O(2^(m+n)), impractical.

Observation: Moving right/down is equivalent to choosing positions for right moves in a sequence of total moves (m-1 + n-1)

Combinatorial idea: Number of unique paths = C(m+n-2, m-1)

Dynamic Programming approach: Let dp[i][j] = number of paths to cell (i,j)

Transition: dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]

Base cases: dp[0][j] = 1 (first row), dp[i][0] = 1 (first column)

4. Approaches & Complexity Analysis â€“

Brute Force â€“ Recursive:

Explore all possible paths recursively

Time Complexity: O(2^(m+n))

Space Complexity: O(m+n) for recursion stack

Optimized â€“ Dynamic Programming / Combinatorics:

DP fills a table of size mÃ—n

Combinatorial formula directly computes C(m+n-2, m-1)

Time Complexity: O(m*n) for DP or O(min(m,n)) for combinatorial formula

Space Complexity: O(m*n) or O(n) with optimized rolling array

5. Example Walkthrough â€“

Example 1: m = 3, n = 7

Total moves = 3-1 + 7-1 = 8

Choose positions for 2 downs â†’ C(8,2) = 28

Output: 28

Example 2: m = 3, n = 2

Total moves = 3-1 + 2-1 = 3

Choose positions for 2 downs â†’ C(3,2) = 3

Output: 3

6. Patterns / Algorithms â€“

General Category: Dynamic Programming + Combinatorics
