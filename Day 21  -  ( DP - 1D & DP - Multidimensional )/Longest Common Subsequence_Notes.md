# Longest Common Subsequence

ðŸ”— Problem Link : LeetCode 1143 â€“ Longest Common Subsequence

â€¢ Problem Classification : Category â†’ Dynamic Programming / String Matching
Pattern â†’ 2D DP Table for Subsequence Matching

1. Problem Statement â€“

Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence (LCS).

A subsequence is a new string formed by deleting zero or more characters from the original string without changing the order.

A common subsequence exists in both strings. If none exists, return 0.

2. Constraints & Edge Cases â€“

1 â‰¤ text1.length, text2.length â‰¤ 1000

Characters: only lowercase English letters

Edge Cases:

One string is empty â†’ LCS length = 0

Both strings are identical â†’ LCS length = string length

No common characters â†’ LCS length = 0

3. Intuition & Thought Process â€“

Naive idea: Generate all subsequences â†’ exponential, infeasible

Observation: Use 2D dynamic programming to build solution iteratively

Let dp[i][j] = length of LCS of text1[0..i-1] and text2[0..j-1]

Transition:

If text1[i-1] == text2[j-1] â†’ dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1

Else â†’ dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])

Base case: dp[0][*] = 0, dp[*][0] = 0

4. Approaches & Complexity Analysis â€“

Brute Force:

Generate all subsequences of both strings

Compare each pair â†’ exponential time

Time Complexity: O(2^(m+n))

Space Complexity: O(m+n) recursion

Optimized â€“ DP:

Build 2D table of size mÃ—n

Time Complexity: O(m*n)

Space Complexity: O(m*n) (can optimize to O(min(m,n)) with rolling array)

5. Example Walkthrough â€“

Example 1: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"

dp table builds incrementally

LCS = "ace" â†’ length = 3

Example 2: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"

LCS = "abc" â†’ length = 3

Example 3: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"

No common subsequence â†’ length = 0

6. Patterns / Algorithms â€“

Primary Pattern: 2D DP for subsequence matching

General Category: String DP + Matching

7. Related Problems â€“

Minimum Delete Sum (LeetCode 712)

8. Key Insights & Interview Considerations â€“

Recognize overlapping subproblems

DP table stores subproblem solutions

Rolling array can optimize space

Corner cases: empty strings, fully matched strings

9. Interview Follow-up â€“

Reconstruct the LCS, not just length

Handle more than 2 strings â†’ generalized LCS

Apply to real-time streaming input for text comparison
