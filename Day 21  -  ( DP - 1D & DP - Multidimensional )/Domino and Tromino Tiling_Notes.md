Domino and Tromino Tiling

ðŸ”— Problem Link : LeetCode 790 â€“ Domino and Tromino Tiling

â€¢ Problem Classification : Category â†’ Dynamic Programming / Combinatorics.
Pattern â†’ 2Ã—n Board Tiling with Linear Recurrence.

1. Problem Statement â€“

You are given a 2Ã—n board and two types of tiles:

Domino â€“ 2Ã—1 or 1Ã—2

Tromino â€“ L-shaped 2Ã—2 with one square missing (can rotate)

You need to compute the number of ways to completely tile the 2Ã—n board. Two tilings are considered different if there exists at least one pair of 4-directionally adjacent cells that are covered differently in the two tilings.

Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

2. Constraints & Edge Cases â€“

Constraints:

1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 1000

Edge Cases:

n = 1 â†’ Only one way (single domino vertically)

n = 2 â†’ Multiple domino and tromino arrangements

Large n â†’ Efficient DP is required; naive recursion is infeasible

Rotations of tromino create multiple configurations; must account for symmetry

3. Intuition & Thought Process â€“

First thought: Try recursively placing dominoes and trominoes at each position â†’ leads to exponential time.

Key observation: Use dynamic programming with linear recurrence:

Let dp[i] = number of ways to tile a 2Ã—i board.

Place a vertical domino â†’ contributes dp[i-1] ways

Place two horizontal dominoes â†’ contributes dp[i-2] ways

Place tromino â†’ contributes 2*dp[i-3] ways (because L-shape can be flipped)

Resulting recurrence:
dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] + 2*dp[i-3]

Base cases:

dp[0] = 1 (empty board)

dp[1] = 1

dp[2] = 2

This approach avoids combinatorial explosion and handles rotations systematically.

4. Approaches & Complexity Analysis â€“

Brute Force â€“ Recursive Backtracking:

Place tiles in all valid positions recursively

Time Complexity: O(3^n) (exponential)

Space Complexity: O(n) recursion stack

Optimized â€“ Dynamic Programming:

Use recurrence dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] + 2*dp[i-3]

Fill dp array iteratively

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n) (can be reduced to O(1) using rolling variables)

5. Example Walkthrough â€“

Example 1: n = 3

dp[0] = 1

dp[1] = 1

dp[2] = 2

dp[3] = dp[2] + dp[1] + 2dp[0] = 2 + 1 + 21 = 5

Output: 5

Example 2: n = 1

Only one way with a vertical domino â†’ dp[1] = 1

Output: 1

8. Key Insights & Interview Considerations â€“

Recognize the tiling problem forms a linear recurrence; explicit combinatorial counting is inefficient

Properly handle rotations and overlapping L-shapes

Modulo arithmetic is necessary to prevent overflow for large n

9. Interview Follow-up â€“

Extend problem to 3Ã—n boards or general mÃ—n boards

Count tilings using only certain tiles or restrict rotations

Optimize for memory using rolling variables
