Minimum Flips to Make a OR b Equal to c

ðŸ”— Problem Link : LeetCode 1318 â€“ Minimum Flips to Make a OR b Equal to c

â€¢ Problem Classification : Category â†’ Bit Manipulation
â€¢ Pattern â†’ Bitwise Comparison

1. Problem Statement

We are given three positive integers a, b, and c.

The goal is to calculate the minimum number of bit flips in a and b so that:

(a OR b) == c


Flip operation: change a single bit from 0 â†’ 1 or 1 â†’ 0.

2. Constraints & Edge Cases

Input Size: 1 <= a, b, c <= 10^9

Edge Cases:

a OR b is already equal to c â†’ flips = 0

Large integers â†’ iterate over bits safely

Only some bits need flipping â†’ optimize by checking each bit individually

3. Intuition & Thought Process

Compare each bit position from LSB to MSB:

Case 1: c_bit == 0 â†’ both a_bit and b_bit must be 0 â†’ count 1 flip for each 1 in a_bit or b_bit

Case 2: c_bit == 1 â†’ at least one of a_bit or b_bit must be 1 â†’ flip only if both are 0

Iterate through all 32 bits (or 31 for positive numbers)

4. Approaches & Complexity Analysis

Brute Force: Convert to binary string â†’ compare â†’ O(32) per number

Optimized Bitwise Approach:

Initialize flips = 0
For i = 0 to 31:
    a_bit = (a >> i) & 1
    b_bit = (b >> i) & 1
    c_bit = (c >> i) & 1

    If c_bit == 0:
        flips += a_bit + b_bit
    Else:
        if a_bit == 0 and b_bit == 0:
            flips += 1


Time Complexity: O(32) â†’ effectively O(1)

Space Complexity: O(1)

5. Example Walkthrough

Example 1: a = 2, b = 6, c = 5
Binary: 010, 110, 101
Flip steps:

Bit 0: 0 | 0 â†’ need 1 â†’ flip a_bit â†’ 1

Bit 1: 1 | 1 â†’ matches c â†’ 0 flips

Bit 2: 0 | 1 â†’ matches c â†’ 0 flips
Total flips: 3

Example 2: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 â†’ already satisfied â†’ flips = 0

8. Key Insights & Interview Considerations

Handle each bit individually

Keep operations minimal â†’ O(1) runtime

Edge cases: one or both bits are already correct â†’ avoid unnecessary flips

9. Interview Follow-up

Extend to large integers â†’ 64-bit numbers

Minimize flips if multiple OR conditions required

Streaming integers â†’ maintain rolling flip count
