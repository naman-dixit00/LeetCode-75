Implement Trie (Prefix Tree)

ðŸ”— Problem Link : LeetCode 208 â€“ Implement Trie (Prefix Tree)

â€¢ Problem Classification : Category â†’ Data Structure / Trie / String
â€¢ Pattern â†’ Prefix Storage + Tree Traversal

1. Problem Statement

We are asked to implement a Trie, which is a specialized tree used for storing strings efficiently. The Trie allows us to perform operations like:

Insert a word

Search for a word

Check if any word starts with a given prefix

Operations to implement:

Trie() â†’ Initializes the trie object.

insert(String word) â†’ Inserts word into the trie.

search(String word) â†’ Returns true if word exists in the trie.

startsWith(String prefix) â†’ Returns true if any word starts with prefix.

Applications:

Autocomplete systems

Spell checkers

Search engines

2. Constraints & Edge Cases

Input size: 1 <= word.length, prefix.length <= 2000

Character set: only lowercase English letters

Number of calls: At most 3 * 10^4 calls for insert, search, and startsWith

Edge Cases:

Empty trie â†’ search should return false

Prefix not present â†’ startsWith returns false

Words of maximum length â†’ memory efficiency matters

Multiple inserts of the same word â†’ should not create duplicates

3. Intuition & Thought Process

Observation: Trie nodes represent characters, and paths from the root represent prefixes of words.

Node Structure: Each node has:

An array (or map) of children nodes corresponding to the 26 lowercase letters

A flag indicating if a word ends at this node

Insert Logic: For each character in the word, traverse the path and create nodes if missing. Mark the last node as end-of-word.

Search Logic: Traverse character by character; if any node is missing, word doesn't exist. At the last character, check end-of-word flag.

Prefix Check: Traverse like search; do not check end-of-word flag.

4. Approaches & Complexity Analysis

Brute Force:

Store all words in an array â†’ search is O(n * m) for n words of length m â†’ inefficient

Optimized Approach (Trie):

Use a tree structure â†’ each node has 26 pointers (children)

Insert: O(m), where m = length of word

Search: O(m)

Prefix Check: O(p), where p = length of prefix

Space Complexity:

O(n * m) â†’ worst case all words are different and non-overlapping

Can be optimized with compressed Trie / Radix Tree

5. Example Walkthrough

Example Input:

["Trie","insert","search","search","startsWith","insert","search"]
[[],["apple"],["apple"],["app"],["app"],["app"],["app"]]


Step-by-step:

Initialize Trie â†’ empty root node

Insert "apple" â†’ create nodes a â†’ p â†’ p â†’ l â†’ e, mark e as end-of-word

Search "apple" â†’ traverse path, e is end-of-word â†’ True

Search "app" â†’ traverse a â†’ p â†’ p, not end-of-word â†’ False

startsWith "app" â†’ path exists â†’ True

Insert "app" â†’ traverse existing a â†’ p â†’ p, mark p as end-of-word

Search "app" â†’ p is now end-of-word â†’ True

Output: [null, null, true, false, true, null, true]

8. Key Insights & Interview Considerations

Efficient memory usage by reusing nodes for common prefixes

Consider alphabet size â†’ 26 for lowercase letters, or 128/256 for ASCII

Can optimize search by storing counts at nodes for quick prefix queries

Edge cases: inserting the same word multiple times, searching for non-existent words

9. Interview Follow-up

Extend to support wildcards / regular expressions in search

Implement compressed Trie to reduce memory usage

Design Trie to handle Unicode characters or variable alphabet
