# Is Subsequence

ðŸ”— Problem Link : LeetCode 392 â€“ Is Subsequence
(https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/
)

â€¢ Problem Classification :

Category â†’ String Matching

Pattern â†’ Two-Pointer Scan

â€¢ Problem Statement -

We are given two strings s and t.

Return true if s is a subsequence of t, else false.

A subsequence can be formed by deleting some (or none) characters from t without changing relative order.

â€¢ Constraints & Edge Cases -

0 <= s.length <= 100

0 <= t.length <= 10^4

Characters: lowercase English letters

â€¢ Edge Cases :

s empty â†’ always true.

t empty and s non-empty â†’ false.

Both empty â†’ true.

s longer than t â†’ false.

â€¢ Intuition & Thought Process -

First thought : Try deleting chars from t and compare â†’ inefficient.

Key idea : Use two pointers â€“ one for s, one for t.

Traverse t, whenever s[i] == t[j], move pointer i.

If we finish scanning s, itâ€™s a subsequence.

Approaches & Complexity Analysis -

â€¢ Brute Force Approach :

Generate all subsequences of t and check.

Time: O(2^n) â†’ infeasible.

â€¢ Optimized Two-Pointer Approach :
Step 1: Initialize i=0 for s, j=0 for t.
Step 2: While j < len(t):

If s[i] == t[j], increment i.

Always increment j.
Step 3: Return true if i == len(s).

Time: O(|t|)

Space: O(1)

â€¢ Example Walkthrough -

Input: s="abc", t="ahbgdc"

Matching process: aâ†’yes, bâ†’yes, câ†’yes â†’ return true.

â€¢ Patterns / Algorithms -

Primary Pattern : Two-Pointer String Scan

General Category : Subsequence Checking

â€¢ Related Problems :

Longest Common Subsequence (LeetCode 1143)

Distinct Subsequences (LeetCode 115)

â€¢ Key Insights & Interview Considerations -

For multiple queries s1, s2...sk â†’ preprocess t with indexing.

This allows binary search for each character.

â€¢ Follow-up Discussion :

How to optimize if k is very large (10^9 queries)?

Can we use DP for generalized subsequence checks?
